# Feh-ACL-Fel-Beet

### About:
This project was made to showcase our collaborative skills at using Git and Github, and develop our programming skills in web development

### Build status:
- Alpha 0.1: Essential features completed and operational

### Theme
This project is an online learning system, where users can log on and register for courses, as well as complete exercises for those courses. They can also receive a certificate when they complete the course. Instructors and corporate trainees can also use the platform, where corporate trainees complete courses preassigned to them, and instructors grade and assess trainees themselves.

### Overview
The platform was implemented with a typical frontend-backend architecture. The development roughly followed a collaborative Agile system, wherein requirements and user stories were completed incrementally.

### Objectives
- Learn how to use Github effectively to coordinate systems between developers
- Effectively construct an application usign MongoDB, Express, Node, and React
- Complete client specific requirements to finish a project

### Frontend Tools and Frameworks
##### [React:](https://opensource.fb.com/projects/react/)
React is a JavaScript library developed by Meta and designed for building single-page web apps UIs.
##### [MUI - Material UI:](https://mui.com/)
Material UI is a component library designed to be used with React which contains all manner of UI components.

### Backend Tools and Frameworks
##### [MongoDB:](https://www.mongodb.com/home)
MongoDB is a NoSQL distributed database designed to be used with distributed applications. It stores data in JSON-style objects which are convenient for usage with JS in the web app.
##### [Node.js:](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
Node.js is an event-driven runtime for JavaScript that works to run scripts outside of a web application and helps manage connections in a scalable manner.
##### [Express.js:](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
Express.js is a web framework designed to be used with Node to create web app servers. It comes with many useful features preinstalled and is very flexible and scalable.

### Development Roadmap
Typical development occurs on a sprint basis. At the beginning of each sprint, requirements are added to the to-do list and distributed to the developers that would be most useful in executing them. At the end of the sprint, completed requirements are assessed, and non-completed ones are pushed to the requirements for the next sprint.
